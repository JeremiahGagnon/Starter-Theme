== Description ==

This theme is my template starter theme. It basically includes all the useful
functionality / UI stuff I commonly want in my WP projects. I can start with
this theme and build my custom CSS for the majority of my design projects.

Boostrap 4.0 and dependancies are baked into the header/footer using CDN links
This theme assumes navigation menus will be baked into header/footer

Webfonts will be loaded using the functions with the "preconnect"
method in v2.0. Font Face Observer will render fonts as soon as they become 
available (register promises in js).

font-awesome embed link is baked into the header.
